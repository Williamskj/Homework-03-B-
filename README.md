# What I did and why I did it

When doing this project, I had a difficult time trying to understand why the beginning code was the way it was. I had to go through several tutorials on password generation. THis assignment also was very confusing for a very specific reason. The Acceptance criteria did not match the example given for the password generator. Along with that, the beginning code also didn't match the acceptance criteria for the assignment. Specifically, in regards that we had to have boxes to determine the criteria of the password that was gonna be generated. For this reason, I found it much more difficult to get started and what exactly to do. For this reason, I have made 2 password generators. The one in this repository follows the criteria more thoroughly and changes quite a bit of the html and the base js given. The one in Homework-03-A- follows the example and is more simple and basic, while not changing any of base html and little of the base js. I'm not sure which one is the one that is considered correct, but Thats the process.
